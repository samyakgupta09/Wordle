# Wordle

In this project, I implement the wordle game using python classes.

## Game rules

* The objective is to guess a n letter word, where n is inputted by the user.
* The game begins by guessing a word, to which the game gives a feedback on which letters are in the word and which of those letter are correctly placed. This is done repeatedly until the correct answer is guessed.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Libraries used: random, collections.abc

## How to run
* Run console_wordle.py file to play interactively
* Run auto_wordle.py to run the game automatically
